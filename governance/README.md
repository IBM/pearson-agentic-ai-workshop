# 🚀 Instructor's Guide: Customize your Own Bootcamp!
## 🤖 What is the AI Governance Bootcamp?

The **AI Governance Bootcamp** is a hands-on, modular learning experience designed by **IBM Client Engineering** for Clients and Business Partners. The goal is for the Client or Business Partner team to learn and implement AI Governance capabilities to deploy AI systems with trust and compliance.

### 🚀 Customize it!
🔨 **Build your own bootcamp** curriculum: pick your learning materials, hands-on labs, demos, and other resources, and tailor the bootcamp to your Client or Business Partner, depending on their interests and skill levels.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo contains instructions and materials to help you **customize** and run your own AI Governance bootcamp for clients. However, you're welcome to bring your own resources as well!
> Since each client has different skill levels, expectations, and interests, it's essential to tailor the material to their needs before the bootcamp.


## 🎯 What's the goal?
🚀 Show the value of AI Governance technology quickly with lower commitment from the client.

🚀 Get clients excited with a tangible outcome and learning experience, generate a pilot, or progress a deal. 

🚀 **Audience:** Clients or Business Partners interested in AI Governance.

🚀 **Run by:** AI Engineers, BTLs, Designers from CE, Brand Technical Specialists, CSMs (as applicable), and more!
