# Lab 1 : Introduction to Prompt Engineering

### watsonx.ai Environments
For self-study and customer demos, when able, the watsonx.ai GA environment should be used.  The GA environment has a limited # of tokens so you would quickly use all of them during this workshop.


So use the [BAM environment](https://bam.res.ibm.com/) for this workshop. The BAM environment should not be used as it includes non-GA (non-generally available) models that may never be GA'd plus it has fewer compute resources than the Tech Preview. This Lab does not require Laptop Setup, anyone with an access to BAM can consume this Lab.
