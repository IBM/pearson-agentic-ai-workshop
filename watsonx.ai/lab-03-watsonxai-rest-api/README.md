 Lab 4: IBM's GenAI REST API & ibm-watsonx-ai library

### Introduction

Watsonx.ai provides multiple programmatic APIs: [Rest](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/watsonx-ai) and [Python SDK](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-ai-python-sdk/v1.4.2/best_practices.html).  In this lab, you'll learn the basics of interacting with watsonx.ai using REST to perform Post and Get operations and using sdk

The ibm-watsonx-ai Python SDK provides convenient access to IBM watsonx.ai services, including foundation models, training, deployment, and inference. It is designed to accelerate AI development and enable interaction with foundation models via a Pythonic interface.
