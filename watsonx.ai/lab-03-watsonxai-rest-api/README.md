 Lab 4: IBM's GenAI REST API

### Introduction
Watsonx.ai provides multiple programmatic APIs: [Node.js](https://bam.res.ibm.com/docs/node), [Python](https://bam.res.ibm.com/docs/ibm-generative-ai) and [REST](https://bam.res.ibm.com/docs/api-reference).  In this lab, you'll learn the basics of interacting with watsonx.ai using REST to perform Post and Get operations.

**Disclaimer: The watsonx.ai REST API is currently in Beta and will change in the future.**
